  <h1 id=interestinit>2. Interest in IT</h1>
  <h2>a.	What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h2>
  <p>I remember it distinctly. The pleasure of witnessing the works of my first 3D print. Holding the product of my own making was a surreal experience. Then, more than ever, is when I fell in love with IT. One of my many interests in learning IT is to better understand the rapid changes in our daily lives. I have always taken a mild interest in IT, and more recently, with significant developments in AI, I feel like it is almost crucial to dig deeper into the world of IT. As mentioned above, the point in time where I began to love IT was when I first started 3D printing. This was in 2020 during the COVID lockdown, and I have since had a lot of time to experiment with this hobby skill. I have also taken an interest in building FPV drones, which has given me knowledge in a range of different skills, such as coding, wiring, and soldering.</p>

  <h2>b.	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
  <p>I have chosen RMIT due to its outstanding reputation. I have always hoped to get into such a distinguished and respected university, and thanks to the online study option, I am now able to. I have been homeschooled for the past four years (currently in year 10). I chose RMIT due to it offering early entry. This has opened up an alternative pathway, allowing me to get a significant headstart in my tertiary education. Starting studying at RMIT this early has given me a challenge that will push me to strive for greater goals.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>c.	What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
  <p>Throughout my studies in IT, I hope to become fluent in more than one programming language, such as HTML, Java and C++. In the future, I believe that all security will be a form of cyber security in one way or another. The rapid movement to an all-technological world presents a need for a detailed understanding of cyber security. In addition to the above, I hope to acquire a broader knowledge of IT. Learning how to apply IT to solve problems in our daily lives is also something that I hope to learn from future studies. IT is already used widely in our everyday lives to solve issues and assist people and businesses in making tasks more accessible and effective. This will only increase over time, and I hope to have the skills to allow me to be at the forefront of this exciting, innovative time.</p>

  <h2>What do the test results mean for you?</h2>
  <p>The above test results show me that certain aspects of myself require room for personal growth if I look forward to being a helpful member in any team environment. The combined results of all three tests show me where I need to focus my attention. For example, the Myers-Brigg test showed that I am 57%  introverted. I plan on challenging myself by engaging more with others with differing personalities. I also see that some of these results are strengths that I can bring to my work and studies.</p>

  <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
  <p>As the above test results show, I am very observant, allowing me to identify work towards solving any team-related issues early on. The Myers-Brigg test also indicates that I am 60% feeling. This will allow me to create a safe environment and a personal connection with team members. I also view myself as flexible concerning learning styles. I can adapt and benefit from a range of presented learning styles.</p>

  <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
  <p>When forming a team, knowing my strengths and weaknesses will help me choose members who both complement my personality style as well as those who can bring to the team qualities that I am not as confident in.</p>

  <h1 id=project>5. Project Idea</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The project idea I have chosen is regarding the application of IT, namely: home automation. Soon enough, everything will be automated and establishing a reliable and universal set standard will allow multiple industry protocols to talk to a common interface. The idea for this project is to create a single device that can communicate to well-known protocols allowing for cross-protocol communication and creating hybrid environments where multiple services and protocols exist simultaneously. Most automated machines today rely on their own protocol, and getting different branded devices to communicate with each other can be challenging. </p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Everyone would love to simplify their tedious day-to-day chores and responsibilities, and often, these things can become burdensome and stressful. A majority of tasks can quickly be done through a form of automation. Some examples include ordering groceries based on what is missing from your pantry/fridge, turning off lights when they are not in use, and reminding homeowners that they need to take the rubbish out on bin day. There are multiple benefits of such simple automations, including energy saving, physical security, and maximising efficient use of resources, to name a few.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Multiple devices, protocols and services to automate homes are available on the market. Each of these provides a walled ecosystem forcing the homeowner to use one product over another, even when a better solution exists in a competing ecosystem. As the automated home increases in popularity, these walled ecosystems become limiting in functionality, ease of use, budget or all of the above.
The ability to use multiple ecosystems simultaneously will greatly improve the adoption of home automation and simplify its use for the common household. This would allow homeowners to simply purchase any of the standardised home automation devices based on standard protocols and be sure that they will interoperate with this project's resultant product.
Perhaps the most crucial feature of this system will be ability to interface with multiple ecosystems from a single pane of glass and a single application rather than relying on multiple applications for each walled garden.
The RPi will be connected to home ethernet networks and can also be accessed via a simple web browser on both desktop and mobile devices. The aim of this centralised hub is to simplify home automation through easy-to-use guided steps that walk through the appropriate steps to create an automation. This could later be developed to use AI to optimise automation further and increase energy savings by learning the homeowners' habits and pre-empting their needs. An example of this would be to turn on the air conditioning before the homeowner arrives home and when the house temperature exceeds a set limit based on the homeowners' previous inputs.
As previously stated, the tools and technologies of this project will mainly consist of an RPi, and how the user interacts with the interface will be up to them. The RPi has been chosen due to its compact design and relatively cheap pricing. The dashboard will be accessible via a simple web page. As long as the user is connected to the internet, this web page can be viewed from anywhere on any device that has a web browser.</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>One of the main elements of this project will be a microcomputer called Rasberry Pi (RPi). This RPi will be able to connect to various branded automation-equipped products and will translate them into a single service that can be used to create cross-platform automation. The RPi will serve as a hub accessible via a simple webpage that can be accessed on a mobile phone or desktop device. This hub can be personalised to the user's preferred layout and will be based on freely available open-source software.</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>For the hub to perform its duties, it will need to be able to talk to the various protocols present in the automation devices. Many of these protocols are open standards with known programming interfaces. This project will need to take advantage of these programming interfaces and will require knowledge of each protocol or standard being used. Since these protocols or standards are open, it should not be difficult to find the necessary skills needed to develop such a solution. The aim of using a small device such as a Raspberry Pi also makes it accessible to most people.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If this project succeeds, homeowners will be able to integrate a number of industry-standard protocols into a single centralised hub, allowing each protocol or service to communicate seamlessly with other protocols.
 Homeowners will have a much better grasp of how mundane, day-to-day tasks affect their lives. In addition, homeowners will be able to keep a close eye on their environmental impact through energy monitoring and reduce their impact through simple electronic devices, which automate the process of, for example, turning devices off when they are not in use.
Homeowners will no longer be tied to a single ecosystem allowing them to create complex cross-platform automation whereby multiple protocols and services can co-exist.</p>
